"""Standard emulator models (ResMLP, ResCNN, ResTRF).

Full networks mapping whitened cosmological parameters to the whitened
data vector. Where this file sits in the training pipeline:

  chi2 = r^T Cinv r

(legend: each box is the data at that stage and the file on each
arrow does the transform; r = the physical residual, prediction
minus truth, scattered to full 3x2pt length; Cinv = the masked
inverse covariance; chi2 = r^T Cinv r, the Mahalanobis distance.)

ResMLP is the baseline: input projection, a stack of identical
ResBlocks, output projection, final Affine. ResCNN and ResTRF add a
correction appendix on a ResMLP trunk: the trunk predicts in the full
(cov-eigenbasis) whitening, fixed buffers map its output into theta
order, a structured head corrects it there, a 1D conv along the
angular axis (ResCNN), or a transformer whose tokens are the
tomographic bins (ResTRF), and a learnable gate adds the correction
back, so swapping the architecture changes only the model. Per-bin
conv variants were tried and removed (see git history).

Each class mixes in DesignSpec: a head_block class attribute (None /
"cnn" / "trf") plus a shared describe_spec classmethod make the class the
single source of its own head-knowledge, read alike by build_specs,
build_geometry, and the startup banner; an architecture that omits
head_block fails at class-definition time.

Whitened = rotated into the covariance eigenbasis and scaled to unit
variance, leaving the components decorrelated and equally hard to fit;
done by the geometry classes (geometries_parameter /
geometries_output).

  (legend: B = batch rows; n_keep = kept data-vector length, the
  unmasked entries the model emulates = output_dim; n_bins = number
  of tomographic (xi+/-, source-pair) bins; max_bin = the longest
  bin's kept theta count = the padded bin width; f / d = the
  full-whitened / diagonal-theta bases, see the W_fd buffers below.)

  The CNN is an additive correction in the diagonal view (theta
  order, per-element /sigma; the full-whitened basis scrambles the
  angular order, so a conv there has no locality). The theta-order
  dv splits into its (xi+/-, source-pair) tomographic bins, and the
  bins become the conv's channels: one Conv1d(n_bins -> n_bins,
  kernel_size) slides a single kernel along theta over the whole
  data vector at once. At every theta position each output bin
  reads a kernel_size-wide window of all the bins, theta-local
  and cross-bin (the bins share one angular grid, so channel mixing
  couples different bins at like angular scales, up to per-bin mask
  offsets). No channel expansion: the head's tensors never grow
  beyond the (padded) dv size, so the bandwidth wall the old
  expand-to-C-filters head hit cannot occur by construction. Each
  block is one conv + one activation (the nonlinearity between
  stacked blocks, without it two convs fold into a single
  kernel). The head hyperparameters are kernel_size (+ the
  rescale_kernel flag), n_blocks_cnn, groups, separable, film, and
  gate_init.

  groups restricts that channel mixing along the one physical cut
  the channel order offers. The channels are the bins in dv order
  the xi+ pairs first, then the xi- pairs (cosmolike's layout,
  reconstructed by build_shear_angle_map), and a grouped conv
  splits the channels into `groups` consecutive blocks that never
  mix:

    channels:   xi+ pair 1 .. P │ xi- pair 1 .. P
                                │
    groups=1:   no cut, every output bin reads every bin (the
                default: full cross-bin mixing)
    groups=2:   cut at the │, xi+ never mixes with xi-, but
                bins still mix freely within their branch

  (legend: P = n_bins/2 source pairs per xi branch; per-block conv
  parameters = n_bins * (n_bins/groups) * kernel_size + n_bins, so
  the cut also halves the head's conv weights. The boundary is
  validated against geom.pm_kept at build: bin_sizes drops
  fully-masked bins, so a wholly-masked bin on one branch would
  silently shift the cut, that fails loudly instead.)

  separable factors the remaining sum's two jobs, smoothing
  along theta and mixing channels, into two cheaper layers per
  block:

    c  (B, C, max_bin)
       │  depthwise Conv1d(C -> C, k, groups=C): each channel its
       │  own k-tap theta filter, no mixing        C*k weights
       ▼
       │  pointwise Conv1d(C -> C, 1, groups=groups): mixes the
       │  channels at each theta position          C*(C/groups)
       ▼
    act  (one activation per block, after the pointwise)

  versus the plain block's joint C*(C/groups)*k. No activation
  sits between the two layers, so the pair composes into a single
  constrained conv, weights w[o, c, t] = pointwise[o, c] *
  depthwise[c, t], i.e. a low-rank factorization of the plain
  block's sum, not a different operation. The assumption the
  factorization adds: the theta-smoothing profile a channel needs
  does not depend on which channel it mixes into (plausible for
  covariance-driven leakage at like angular scales; the standard
  depthwise-separable trade). The zero-init identity start moves
  to the last block's pointwise layer.

  (legend: C = n_bins, the channels; k = the per-block kernel
  width after any rescale; B = batch rows.)

  Bins differ in kept length, so each is padded to max_bin (the
  longest bin's kept theta count) inside a fixed index buffer
  (pad_idx scatters the n_keep theta-order entries into the padded
  (n_bins, max_bin) layout and gathers the corrections back; pad
  slots stay zero). The bin split comes from geom.bin_sizes
  (attached by build_shear_angle_map; the needs_bins flag makes
  EmulatorExperiment run it).

  The head starts as an exact identity: the last conv is
  zero-initialized, so corr = 0 and the model equals its trunk at
  epoch 1 (the zero-init-residual-branch start; gradients reach the
  zeroed conv through the nonzero gate at step 1).

  The two basis-change maps are precomputed and stored as fixed
  buffers, named for the bases: f = full-whitened (the eigenbasis
  the trunk predicts in), d = diagonal (theta order, each element
  scaled by its marginal sigma). Subscripts read in multiply order:
  y_full @ W_fd goes f -> d, correction @ W_df goes d -> f (W_df =
  W_fd inverse). Buffers, not live geometry calls in forward, stay
  safe under torch.compile CUDA graphs.

  Target and loss use the full-whitening DataVectorGeometry, as the
  standalone ResMLP, so swapping ResMLP -> ResCNN changes the model
  only, not the whitening (no confound).

  Arguments:
    input_dim    = number of cosmological parameters.
    output_dim   = data-vector length to emulate (= n_keep).
    int_dim_res  = internal width of the residual trunk.
    geom         = full-whitening DataVectorGeometry carrying
                   bin_sizes; its evecs / sqrt_ev define the basis
                   buffers.
    kernel_size  = conv kernel width (odd, same-padded), tuned as
                   if the head had one block. With rescale_kernel
                   it states the target receptive field; without,
                   it is used verbatim for every block.
    rescale_kernel = False (default): every block uses kernel_size
                   as given. True: the per-block kernel shrinks
                   with depth so the n_blocks_cnn-deep stack keeps
                   a single kernel_size-wide block's view,
                   receptive field n*(k-1)+1 >= kernel_size, see
                   rescale_kernel_size. Depth then buys
                   nonlinearity at a fixed total view (and
                   near-flat head parameters) instead of
                   over-growing the receptive field. The resolved
                   width is stored as self.kernel_size.
    groups       = channel-mixing restriction: 1 (default, dense
                   mixing) or 2 (xi+ never mixes with xi-). See
                   the groups paragraph and graph in the class
                   docstring; other values error, and the xi
                   boundary is validated against geom.pm_kept at
                   build.
    separable    = False (default): one joint conv per block.
                   True: factor each block into a depthwise
                   theta filter + a pointwise channel mix (a
                   low-rank factorization of the same sum, ~k/2
                   times fewer weights). See the separable
                   paragraph and graph in the class docstring.
    film         = False (default): the head is one fixed map,
                   blind to the cosmology. True: re-inject the
                   parameters into every block as a per-channel
                   affine, conv -> gamma(x)*c + beta(x) -> act,
                   with one identity-initialized FiLMGenerator
                   per block (Linear(input_dim, 2*n_bins),
                   ~2*n_bins*input_dim parameters each, see the
                   generator's docstring and
                   notes/film-conditioning.md). The gate stays as
                   the outer valve; FiLM modulates inside the
                   blocks, letting the cosmology choose which
                   bins to amplify and by how much.
    n_blocks     = residual blocks in the trunk.
    n_blocks_cnn = stacked conv+activation correction blocks.
    gate_init    = initial value of the scalar scaling the
                   correction. Small (default 0.1) to start near the
                   pure ResMLP; not 0, a 0 gate strands the CNN
                   with no gradient, so it never learns.
    head_act     = the CNN head's own activation factory (None ->
                   share block_opts["act"], the trunk's family;
                   byte-identical to before). build_specs builds it
                   from model.cnn.activation (or the head: activation:
                   alias); set, it pins the head family only.
    block_opts   = ResBlock options (None -> {}); its "act" is the
                   trunk family and, unless head_act is set, the CNN
                   head's too. Defaults to activation_fcn (the paper's
                   H) when block_opts sets no "act".

  needs_geom / needs_bins are capability flags EmulatorExperiment
  reads: geom injected (basis buffers + bin sizes), compile_mode
  defaulted to "default", and build_shear_angle_map run on the data
  geometry before the model is built.

  """
  ResMLP trunk + a bin-token transformer correction appendix. The
  trunk is the standalone ResMLP, predicting in the full
  (cov-eigenbasis) whitening; the head maps its output into theta
  order (ResCNN's fixed W_fd / W_df buffers), splits it into the
  (xi+/-, source-pair) tomographic bins, and runs a transformer
  whose tokens are those bins. The forward pass, shapes and all:

    x  (B, input_dim)           whitened parameters
       │  self.mlp              the ResMLP trunk
       ▼
    y  (B, n_keep)              full-whitened dv (also the skip)
       │  @ W_fd                f -> d: theta order, /sigma
       ▼
       │  pad_idx scatter       pad slots stay zero
       ▼
    t0 (B, n_bins, max_bin)     one token per bin, width max_bin
       │  n_blocks_trf x TRFBlock
       │                        cross-bin attention + per-bin MLPs
       ▼
    t  (B, n_bins, max_bin)
       │  corr = t - t0         what the blocks added (0 at init)
       │  pad_idx gather, @ W_df    d -> f, back to full whitening
       ▼
    out = y + gate * corr

  (legend: B = batch rows; n_keep = kept data-vector length, the
  unmasked entries the model emulates = output_dim; n_bins = number
  of tomographic (xi+/-, source-pair) bins; max_bin = the longest
  bin's kept theta count = the padded token width; f / d = the
  full-whitened / diagonal-theta bases, see the W_fd buffers below.)

  Attention shares information across bins, then each bin's own MLP
  stack specializes its correction (see TRFBlock for the two
  deviations from a textbook block). A per-bin conv (a removed
  per-bin-conv variant; see git history) refines within bins but
  never across them; attention is the head for cross-bin structure
  in the trunk's residuals.

  The bin split comes from geom.bin_sizes (attached by
  build_shear_angle_map; EmulatorExperiment runs it when the
  needs_bins flag is set). Bins differ in length, so each is padded
  to max_bin (the longest bin's kept theta count) inside a fixed
  index buffer (pad_idx scatters the n_keep theta-order entries
  into the padded (n_bins, max_bin) layout and gathers the
  corrections back; the pad positions stay zero and drop at the
  gather).

  The tokens live at their natural width: max_bin, the padded bin
  length. There is deliberately no embedding layer in and no output
  projection out, those adapters are what a transformer needs
  when its sequence is synthetic (a flat latent split into tokens,
  as in the published CMB design, where they were the parameter-
  heaviest layers); here the sequence structure is physical, so the
  raw bin segments are the tokens and the blocks' output is already
  in dv layout. The correction is corr = blocks(h) - h: every
  TRFBlock is exactly the identity at init (its branch outputs are
  zero-initialized, see TRFBlock), so corr = 0 and the model equals
  its trunk at epoch 1, the same zero-init identity start as the
  conv heads, with the same wake-up chain (the zeroed branch layers
  get real gradients through the nonzero gate at step 1).

  needs_geom / needs_bins are capability flags EmulatorExperiment
  reads: geom injected (basis buffers + bin sizes), compile_mode
  defaulted to "default", and build_shear_angle_map run on the data
  geometry before the model is built.

  Arguments:
    input_dim    = number of cosmological parameters.
    output_dim   = data-vector length to emulate (= n_keep).
    int_dim_res  = internal width of the residual trunk.
    geom         = full-whitening DataVectorGeometry carrying
                   bin_sizes; its evecs / sqrt_ev define the basis
                   buffers.
    n_heads      = attention heads per TRFBlock; must divide the
                   token width max_bin (the LSST-Y1 cosmic-shear
                   run keeps max_bin = 26 theta points per bin,
                   allowing n_heads = 1, 2, or 13; default 2).
    n_blocks     = residual blocks in the trunk.
    n_blocks_trf = stacked transformer blocks.
    n_mlp_blocks = depth of each bin's private MLP stack inside
                   every TRFBlock; every layer runs at the token
                   width (dim -> dim), the interior pinned to the bin
                   length by design (no width knob, depth only).
    gate_init    = initial correction-gate scale (small, not 0,
                   a 0 gate strands the head with no gradient).
    shared_mlp   = False (default): per-bin unique MLPs. True: one
                   MLP shared by every bin, the textbook block,
                   the ablation isolating the unique-MLP deviation
                   (see TRFBlock's permutation-equivariance caveat).
    film         = False (default): the head is one fixed map,
                   blind to the cosmology. True: after every
                   TRFBlock, modulate the token stream with a
                   per-token affine gamma(x)*t + beta(x) from an
                   identity-initialized FiLMGenerator (one per
                   block; tokens play the conv head's channel
                   role, broadcast over the token width). The
                   stream carries the correction (corr = stream -
                   t0), so the cosmology chooses which bins'
                   corrections to amplify; identity init keeps
                   corr = 0 at epoch 1. See FiLMGenerator and
                   notes/film-conditioning.md.
    head_act     = the TRF head's own activation factory (None ->
                   share block_opts["act"], the trunk's family;
                   byte-identical to before). build_specs builds it
                   from model.trf.activation (or the head: activation:
                   alias); set, it pins the head family only.
    block_opts   = ResBlock options (None -> {}); its "act" is the
                   trunk family and, unless head_act is set, reaches
                   the TRF MLPs too.
