"""Factored intrinsic-alignment losses and amplitude coefficients.

The intrinsic-alignment member of the emulator/losses/ family (the
former emulator IA subpackage), paired with the templates in
designs/ia.py. This module holds the losses for the factored IA
emulators and the
amplitude-polynomial coefficient functions they use. nla_coeffs and
tatt_coeffs turn the raw IA amplitudes into the closed-form
coefficients that combine the model's whitened templates into a data
vector, and TemplateFactoredChi2 applies that combine and then scores
the result with the full chi2. The amplitudes enter only here, never
the network.

PS: whitened = rotated into the covariance eigenbasis and scaled to
unit variance, so correlated dv entries become decorrelated and
equally hard to fit; encoded = a dv put through the geometry's encode
(kept entries, centered, whitened); squeeze = keep only the unmasked
dv entries (the geometry's squeeze), the smaller vector the network
emulates.
