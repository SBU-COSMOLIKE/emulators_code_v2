"""Shared nn building blocks (Affine, ResBlock, rescale_kernel_size,
FiLMGenerator, BinLinear, TRFBlock).

This module holds the small nn.Modules that the emulator models
(emulator_designs.py) are assembled from. Each piece sits as follows:

  ResMLP = Linear -> n_blocks x ResBlock -> Linear -> Affine
  ResCNN = ResMLP trunk + conv correction head (bare nn.Conv1d
             layers, needing no block here; the rescale_kernel flag
             resolves the width through rescale_kernel_size)
  ResTRF = ResMLP trunk + TRFBlock correction head
             (per-token unique MLPs = BinLinear)

Affine is a learnable scalar scale and shift (the default ResBlock
"norm" and the models' final layer). ResBlock is a width-preserving
residual block (n dense layers, each with a norm and activation
factory, skip added before the last). rescale_kernel_size shrinks
the conv heads' kernel as their depth grows, preserving a single
block's receptive field. FiLMGenerator predicts the conv heads'
optional per-channel, cosmology-dependent modulation (the film
flag). BinLinear and TRFBlock are the ResTRF
head's pieces: per-token unique linears and a transformer block
whose tokens are the tomographic bins. Grouped / per-bin conv twins
were tried and removed (see git history).

PS: whitened = rotated into the covariance eigenbasis and scaled to unit
variance (defined in the geometry modules, geometries_parameter /
geometries_output); these blocks operate on already-whitened tensors.

    """
    A learnable scalar scale and shift: out = x * gain + bias.

    gain and bias are single scalars (shape (1,)) broadcast over
    every element of x: one global scale and shift, not a

    is the identity. Used as the ResBlock default "norm" factory and
    the final layer of ResMLP / ResCNN.

    Both are nn.Parameter, registered and trained. Weight decay is
    kept off both (make_optimizer decays only ndim >= 2 weight
    matrices): decaying gain toward 0 would attenuate the signal,
    and decaying a bias has no principled meaning.

    A learnable per-feature scale and shift: out = x * gain + bias,
    gain and bias length-`size` vectors (one pair per feature) — the
    per-feature sibling of Affine.

    A "feature" is one coordinate of the width-wide hidden vector
    flowing through the trunk (the ResBlock width, model.mlp.width):
    inside a ResBlock the batch is a (B, size) tensor, and gain / bias
    hold one (g_i, b_i) pair per column, shared across the B rows.
    Affine is the scalar case (one pair for the whole tensor);
    FeatureAffine gives every feature its own operating point, the
    saturation guard the paper's affine escalates to (model.norm
    per_feature). It is the same per-feature sense in which H's gamma /
    beta are learned.

    gain inits to 1, bias to 0, so at init it is the identity. Both are
    nn.Parameter of shape (size,); weight decay is kept off both
    automatically (make_optimizer decays only ndim >= 2 weight
    matrices, and these are ndim 1), exactly as for Affine.

    Arguments:

             feature.

def rescale_kernel_size(kernel_size, n_blocks_cnn):
  """
  Per-block kernel width that preserves a single block's view as
  the conv head deepens.

  kernel_size is read as the width one block alone would use, so it
  states the head's target total view: a single same-padded conv of
  width k sees k positions. n stacked same-padded convs of width
  k_n see

    RF = n * (k_n - 1) + 1

  Why: write r = (k_n - 1)/2 for the kernel radius (odd kernel,
  same-padded). One conv's output at position p is a weighted sum
  of the k_n inputs p-r .. p+r, so one layer sees k_n positions.
  Stack a second conv: its output at p reads the k_n layer-1
  positions p-r .. p+r, and each of those sees its own k_n-wide
  input window. Consecutive layer-1 positions hold windows shifted
  by exactly one column (stride 1), so the union of the k_n
  windows is one contiguous window, k_n - 1 columns wider than
  each. Drawn at k_n = 3 (r = 1):

    y[p]                          layer-2 output: taps
     │         │         │        h[p-1], h[p], h[p+1]
    h[p-1]    h[p]     h[p+1]     layer 1: three k_n-wide input
     │         │         │        windows, each shifted by one
     ▼         ▼         ▼        column
    x[p-2..p] x[p-1..p+1] x[p..p+2]
                                  union = x[p-2 .. p+2]:
                                  5 = 2*(k_n - 1) + 1 positions

  Every extra layer therefore adds the same r of reach per side --
  the new kernel's outermost tap already sits r columns out, and
  looks through a window extending r further. The growth is
  additive, never multiplicative:

    RF_1 = k_n;   RF_(i+1) = RF_i + (k_n - 1)
    =>  RF_n = k_n + (n - 1)(k_n - 1) = n*(k_n - 1) + 1

               y[p]               layer n
              ╱    ╲
          ..........              the cone widens by r per side,
         ╱          ╲             per layer
    x[p - n*r] .. x[p + n*r]      input window = 2*n*r + 1
                                               = n*(k_n - 1) + 1

  (legend: p = a position along the theta axis; r = (k_n - 1)/2, the
  kernel radius per side; k_n = the per-block kernel width; n =
  n_blocks_cnn, the number of stacked conv blocks; x[.] = an input
  position, h[.] = a layer-1 output position, y[.] = the final output
  position; RF = the receptive field, the count of input positions one
  output sees.)

  (Same-padding does not change the count: where the cone hangs
  past the signal's edge it reads padded zeros, not extra data.)

  Without rescaling, deepening the stack over-grows the view (3
  blocks of k = 11, r = 5, reach 3*5 = 15 per side: RF = 31, wider
  than a whole 26-point bin). This helper instead solves RF >=
  kernel_size for the smallest odd k_n (same-padding needs odd):

    k_n = ceil((kernel_size - 1) / n_blocks_cnn) + 1, then odd-up.

  Extra depth then buys nonlinearity at a fixed total view. It also
  keeps the head size nearly flat: per-block conv parameters scale
  with k_n (C_in*C_out*k_n + C_out), so the head total ~
  C^2 * n * k_n ~ C^2 * (kernel_size - 1 + 2n). At kernel_size 27

    RF           : 27   29   31   33   31

  (RF overshoots kernel_size where odd-up rounds; it never
  undershoots.)

  Arguments:
    kernel_size  = the single-block kernel width = the target
                   receptive field (odd).
    n_blocks_cnn = number of stacked conv+activation blocks.

  The caller applies them to a feature map h of shape (B, C, L) as

    gamma.unsqueeze(-1) * h + beta.unsqueeze(-1)

  broadcasting over the length axis: the modulation depends on the
  cosmology and the channel, never on the position, because cosmology
  sets a global property of each channel's piece of the data
  vector, not a per-theta local correction. This is what
  re-injects parameter information into a correction head that
  otherwise only ever sees the trunk's output: without FiLM the
  head is one fixed map applied identically at every point of
  parameter space; with it, the cosmology chooses which channels
  to amplify or suppress, and by how much.

  Identity at init: the weight is zeroed and the bias set to
  gamma = 1, beta = 0, so FiLM starts as a no-op for every input,
  the same identity-start convention as the zero-init conv and
  the TRFBlock branches (the model still equals its trunk exactly
  at epoch 1 and at a two-phase handoff). Gradients reach the
  zeroed weight through the inputs, so it wakes as soon as a
  cosmology-dependent modulation helps.

  Two deliberate deviations from the textbook block:
  - the tokens are physical: a tomographic bin's theta segment
    (plain ResTRF) or a (template, bin) pair's (the factored
    version), so attention shares information across bins (the
    cross-bin correlations a within-bin conv cannot see);
  - the position-wise MLP is not shared (by default): each token
    has its own n_mlp_blocks-deep stack (BinLinear), where a
    standard transformer applies one shared MLP to every token.
    The unique weights specialize each token's correction and
    stand in for the positional encoding (see BinLinear).
    shared_mlp=True restores the textbook shared MLP, the
    ablation baseline isolating that deviation. Caveat: with the
    MLP shared (and the attention maps always shared), nothing in
    the block tells the tokens apart structurally, so the head
    becomes permutation-equivariant over tokens, with no
    positional encoding; token identity then comes only from the
    segments' content.

  The attention projections (wq / wk / wv / wo) are shared across
  tokens, as in any transformer: shared maps are what let every
  token attend to every other with one set of weights; the
  per-token specialization lives in the MLPs.

  The block is exactly the identity at init: both branch outputs
  (wo and the last MLP layer) are zero-initialized, so x passes
  through untouched. A stack of these blocks therefore satisfies
  blocks(x) == x at init, which is what lets the ResTRF head
  define its correction as blocks(h) - h == 0, the zero-init
  identity start, with no output projection to host it. Gradients
  still reach the zeroed layers (a layer's weight gradient depends
  on its inputs, not on its own weights); the layers behind them
  wake one step later.

  LayerNorm (not the package's Affine) opens both branches: the
  softmax's saturation depends on the score scale, so attention
  wants its inputs actively normalized, and pre-LN is the
  stable-training default for transformers.

  Arguments:
    dim          = token width = max_bin, the padded bin length
                   (must be divisible by n_heads; the LSST-Y1
                   cosmic-shear run keeps max_bin = 26 theta
                   points per bin, allowing n_heads = 1, 2, or
                   13).
    n_tokens     = number of tokens G.
    n_heads      = attention heads (each head attends over all G
                   tokens with dim/n_heads of the features).
    n_mlp_blocks = depth of each token's private MLP stack; every
                   layer runs at the token width (dim -> dim), the
                   interior width pinned to the bin length by design
                   (no width knob, n_mlp_blocks sets depth only).
    act          = activation factory act(dim) -> module for the
                   MLP layers (the run's activation; defaults to
                   activation_fcn, the paper's H).
    shared_mlp   = False (default): per-token unique MLPs
                   (BinLinear). True: one MLP shared by every
                   token (plain nn.Linear applied position-wise),
                   the textbook block, see the caveat above.

  forward Arguments:
    x = input tensor of shape (B, G, dim); B = batch rows, G =
        n_tokens, dim = the per-token width.

  Returns:
    a tensor of shape (B, G, dim): the block's output, equal to x
    at init (both residual branches are zero-initialized).
