"""Chi2 losses and the robustness annealing schedule.

The loss layer: each class holds a DataVectorGeometry (composition, not
inheritance) and adds the chi2 (the masked Mahalanobis distance
r^T Cinv r per sample) and the training loss on it. CosmolikeChi2 is the
plain loss (trimming, a focal hardness weight, a sqrt / pseudo-Huber
transform). RescaledChi2 and ResidualBaseChi2 are the two analytic-R
variants (R divides the net output, versus R moves only the baseline).
ElementWeightedChi2 up-weights the worst-fit dv elements. anneal_value is
the per-epoch trim / focus schedule; make_chi2 builds the right loss from
a geometry and a rescale mode.

PS: the Mahalanobis distance r^T Cinv r is a squared residual r weighted
by the inverse covariance Cinv (this is the chi2); "masked" means only
the unmasked data-vector entries the analysis keeps enter the sum; a loader
is a closure load(rows) -> a ready-to-train batch on the device (built in
batching.py), the source of the batches these losses score.
