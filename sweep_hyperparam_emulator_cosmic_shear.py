#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example how to run this program
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This driver sweeps a single hyperparameter (chosen in the YAML, one value per
# training run at a fixed N_train) and records validation f(delta-chi2 >
# threshold) per value, with the same table + figure outputs as the N_train
# sweep. sweep_ntrain_emulator_cosmic_shear.py stays the driver for the N_train
# axis (its points have unequal cost and its staging differs per point); this
# one covers every other knob: batch size, learning rate, kernel size, film
# on/off, the activation family, ...
#
# python .../emultrfv2/sweep_hyperparam_emulator_cosmic_shear.py \
#   --root projects/lsst_y1/ \
#   --fileroot emulators/training_scripts/ \
#   --yaml train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.yaml \
#   --out lrsweep_rescnn
#
#- The swept knob lives in a `sweep` block of the same training YAML (one YAML
#  serves every driver). `parameter` is the dotted path of exactly one
#  train_args leaf; `values` the list to try:
#
#      sweep:
#        parameter: lr.lr_base
#        values:
#          - 0.0010
#          - 0.0025
#          - 0.0063
#
#  Any train_args leaf works by its dotted path: top-level knobs (bs, clip,
#  trunk_epochs), sub-block knobs (scheduler.patience, trim.start,
#  model.cnn.kernel_size, model.cnn.film, model.mlp.width), and per-phase
#  overrides (head.lr.lr_base, whose intermediate blocks are created if the
#  YAML omits them; a phase axis on a single-phase model is rejected at
#  startup by validate_sweep_paths). Values may be numbers, strings,
#  or booleans (film: [false, true]).
#
#  Two special cases:
#  - model.activation (or model.activation.type) sweeps the activation family:
#    the driver sets the experiment's resolved activation per value (the
#    --activation flag must then be left unset); values are the family names
#    (H, power, multigate, gated_power). model.activation.n_gates sweeps as an
#    ordinary leaf.
#  - model.name / model.ia are refused: they change the model class, so
#    comparing architectures is one sweep per architecture (or the bake-off
#    driver), not one sweep across them.
#
#- Per value: a fresh model is trained on the same staged data and geometry
#  (staged once per worker, since the data does not vary across values, unlike
#  the N_train sweep) and scored as f(delta-chi2 > --threshold) on the fixed
#  val set.
#
#- Multiple GPUs (one node): values are near-equal-cost jobs, so they split
#  round-robin, one process per GPU (spawn; each worker stages its own copy
#  and streams from the shared dump memmap). One GPU (or the Apple-MPS dev
#  machine) falls back to a serial loop. `--gpu-pack` (off by default)
#  additionally co-locates up to 4 trainings per GPU when each is estimated
#  at <= 20% of the card (<= 40% -> 2), worth it on an H200, not on an
#  RTX 3060; see sweep_ntrain's header for the full rationale and caveats.
#
#- `--root` / `--fileroot` / `--yaml`: the cocoa layout, as in the training
#  driver (data under --root/chains, YAML + outputs under --fileroot).
#- `--rescale` / `--activation`: fixed across the sweep, as in the training
#  driver (--activation conflicts with sweeping model.activation).
#- `--n-gpus` (default: all visible CUDA devices): GPUs to spread across.
#- `--gpu-pack`: co-locate small trainings on one GPU (see above; off by
#  default).
#- `--threshold` (default 0.2): delta-chi2 cutoff the fraction counts.
#- `--out` (default hyperparam_sweep): writes <out>.txt (save_sweep_table:
#  numeric values as a value/frac table, categorical as index/frac with a
#  label map line) and <out>.pdf (plot_sweep_curve), under --fileroot.
#- `--quiet`: suppress stdout (txt and pdf still written).
#
#- Trains one full model per value, so run it on a machine with a working
#  Cocoa installation (cosmolike).
