"""This driver traces the f(delta-chi2 > thr) vs N_train learning curve.

PS: a loader is a closure load(rows) -> a ready-to-train batch on the
device, hiding where the data lives; dump = the full on-disk array from the
data-generation run (the dv dump is the .npy, the param dump the .txt);
memmap = a NumPy array backed by that file, read in slices so it is never
loaded whole.
"""

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example how to run this program
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This driver sweeps the training-set size for one fixed config, recording
# validation f(delta-chi2 > threshold) at each size: the learning curve telling
# whether the floor is data-limited (still falling at the largest N) or
# capacity / architecture-limited (a flat tail).
#
# python .../emultrfv2/sweep_ntrain_emulator_cosmic_shear.py \
#   --root projects/lsst_y1/ \
#   --fileroot emulators/training_scripts/ \
#   --yaml train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.yaml \
#   --n-min 2000 --n-points 6 --out ntrain_resmlp
#
#- Reuses the training driver's YAML (and its model/rescale/activation choices).
#  To compare architectures or chi2 modes, run once per config (vary
#  train_args.model.name or --rescale / --activation, with a different --out),
#  then overlay the saved <out>.txt curves.
#
#- Per N_train (geometric grid [--n-min .. --n-max], --n-max defaults to the
#  full physically-cut pool), stages a nested subset of that size, rebuilds the
#  geometry from it, trains a fresh model silently, and scores
#  f(delta-chi2 > --threshold) on the fixed validation set.
#
#- Multiple GPUs (one node): grid points are independent trainings, so they run
#  in parallel, one process per GPU, split by the Longest-Processing-Time rule
#  (largest N_train first to the least-loaded GPU) so each GPU gets about the
#  same total N_train and they finish together. On an 8-GPU node, add
#  `--n-points 12 --n-gpus 8` to the call above.
#
#  One GPU (or none, e.g. the Apple-MPS dev machine) falls back to a serial
#  loop, so the same script runs everywhere.
#
#- `--gpu-pack` (optional, off by default): co-locate several trainings on one
#  GPU when they are small. Each point's VRAM need is estimated conservatively
#  (2 * N * dv_width float32 + a 2 GiB fixed overhead, see
#  emulator/scheduling.py); a point at or below 20% of the card shares it up
#  to 4 ways, one at or below 40% up to 2 ways, anything bigger runs
#  exclusive. It engages even with a single visible GPU (a lone H200
#  allocation: up to 4 small points co-located on the one card). Worth it on
#  a large card (H200) where a small-N training is
#  launch-bound and leaves most of the GPU idle; leave it off on a small card
#  (an RTX 3060: the fixed overhead alone is ~17% of 12 GB, and co-located
#  contexts would crowd out the data). If a point outgrows its estimate the
#  loaders degrade to streaming against the real free VRAM rather than crash.
#  Keep it off for timing measurements: co-located points contend and their
#  s/epoch is not comparable to exclusive runs.
#
#- `--root` (required): project folder under $ROOTDIR (data resolves under it);
#  `--fileroot` (required): subfolder holding the YAML and curve outputs (e.g.
#  emulators/training_scripts). Cocoa layout, as in the training driver.
#- `--yaml` (default test.yaml): config under --fileroot, or an absolute path
#  used as-is (data + train_args), training-driver schema;
#  train_args.model.name picks the architecture
#  (resmlp | rescnn | restrf) and model.ia the factored IA design layered
#  on it (omit | nla | tatt), with the nested mlp / activation / cnn /
#  trf sub-blocks, the optional two-phase trunk_epochs + trunk / head
#  override blocks, and the clip / rewind guards; see the training
#  driver's header for every key. The `data` block lists bare filenames,
#  resolved under --root/chains.
#- `--rescale` / `--activation`: as in the training driver, fixed across the
#  sweep (analytic-R mode and ResBlock activation).
#- `--n-gpus` (default: all visible CUDA devices): GPUs to spread across. 1, or
#  no CUDA, is serial.
#- `--n-min` (default 2000), `--n-max` (default = pool), `--n-points` (default
#  5): geometric N_train grid (clamped to the pool, deduplicated).
#- `--threshold` (default 0.2): delta-chi2 cutoff the fraction counts.
#- `--out` (default ntrain_sweep): writes <out>.txt (curve + config,
#  np.loadtxt-loadable) and <out>.pdf (single-curve figure), under --fileroot.
#- `--quiet`: suppress stdout (txt and pdf still written).
#
#- Trains one full model per grid point (--n-points trainings, divided across
#  the GPUs), so run it on a machine with a working Cocoa installation
#  (cosmolike).
