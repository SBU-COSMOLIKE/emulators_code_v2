"""

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to run this program
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This driver is the tuning twin of train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.py: it
# reuses the same single cosmic-shear (xi) emulator setup (resmlp | rescnn |
# restrf, optionally with a factored ia design, per the YAML), but runs an
# Optuna study minimizing validation f(delta-chi2 > 0.2) rather than one run.
#
# python .../emultrfv2/tune_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.py \
#   --root projects/lsst_y1/ \
#   --fileroot emulators/training_scripts/ \
#   --yaml train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.yaml \
#   --n-trials 50 --timeout 4200
#
#- The searched hyperparameters come from the YAML train_args block. Each leaf is
#  a fixed scalar or a range: a 4-item list [default, min, max, kind], kind int /
#  float / log (a whitespace string "default min max kind" also works). A range
#  may sit at any nesting depth: inside the model sub-blocks (model.mlp.width,
#  model.cnn.kernel_size), the schedules (trim.start), or the per-phase
#  trunk / head override blocks (head.lr.lr_base):
#
#      lr:
#        lr_base: [0.0025, 1.0e-5, 1.0e-1, log]   # searched, log scale
#        bs_base: 64.0                            # fixed
#      model:
#        mlp:
#          width:    [128, 64, 256, int]          # searched, integer
#          n_blocks: 4                            # fixed
#
#  The first value is the default: the training driver uses it and this search
#  warm-starts trial 0 from it, so one YAML serves both drivers.
#
#- Multiple GPUs (one node): trials are independent trainings, so the study
#  parallelizes, one worker process per GPU (spawn), all sharing a single study
#  through an Optuna journal-file storage under --fileroot. Each worker builds
#  its own experiment on its GPU, asks the shared study for suggestions
#  (sampler seeded per worker), and reports results back; --n-trials is the
#  total across workers. The journal file persists: rerunning with the same
#  --journal resumes the study (more trials on top of the recorded ones);
#  delete the file (or pass a fresh --journal name) to start over. One GPU
#  (or the Apple-MPS dev machine) keeps the original serial in-memory study,
#  no file written.
#
#- `--root` (required): project folder under $ROOTDIR (data resolves under it);
#  `--fileroot` (required): subfolder holding the YAML (e.g.
#  emulators/training_scripts). Cocoa layout, as in the training driver.
#- `--yaml` (default test.yaml): config under --fileroot, or an absolute path
#  used as-is, `data` + `train_args` blocks (training driver schema; train_args
#  may now carry ranges). The `data` block lists bare filenames, resolved under
#  --root/chains.
#- `--n-trials` (default 50) and `--timeout` (seconds, optional) bound the study
#  (the timeout applies per worker in the parallel path).
#- `--n-gpus` (default: all visible CUDA devices): GPUs to spread trials
#  across. 1, or no CUDA, is the serial path.
#- `--journal` (default tune_journal.log): the shared study's journal file
#  under --fileroot (parallel path only). Persistent: same name resumes,
#  new name starts fresh.
#- `--rescale` / `--activation` set the analytic-R mode and ResBlock activation,
#  fixed across the study, not searched (see the training driver).
#- `--quiet` suppresses all stdout (per-trial lines and final summary).
#
#- The fixed single-emulator choices (probe = xi, AdamW, ReduceLROnPlateau,
#  use_amp = False, report thresholds, the (name, ia) MODELS registry) are
#  EmulatorExperiment defaults (emulator/experiment.py), shared with the training
#  driver. The model is the YAML's (train_args.model.name = resmlp | rescnn |
#  restrf, plus model.ia = omit | nla | tatt), also fixed; only hyperparameters
#  vary.
#
#- Output: stdout, a per-trial line (frac>0.2, running best, params) and a
#  final summary of the best frac>0.2 and params, plus, in the parallel
#  path, the persistent journal file.
